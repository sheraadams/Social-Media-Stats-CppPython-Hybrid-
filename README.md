This program calls python file functions to read a text file that lists social media sites visited in a  period and print out different kinds of reports. The input file (socialmedia.txt) lists sites as they are visited by name (GitHub, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest). The program reads the file and creates a .dat file that lists the name of site and the total count of site visits for each site. 

The program menu allows the user to lookup a social media site by name and find the total number of site visits for the period. The user can also choose to print a histogram of all sites or print out a report of all sites and visits to the console.
